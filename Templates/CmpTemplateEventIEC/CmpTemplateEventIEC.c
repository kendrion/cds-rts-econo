 * <name>CmpTemplateEventIEC.c</name>
 * <description> 
 *	Simple example about using runtime system events in IEC applications.
 *
 *	Runtime system events are posted by various runtime components, and can be catched by other components by registering a callback function.
 *	They can be used for communication between runtime system components, and between runtime system components and the IEC application.
 *	The communication using events is more flexible than function calls, because the component that posts the event needs not to know the components that register to the event,
 *	and because a function call from runtime component to IEC application is not possible otherwise.
 *	This example shows how to generate events, and how to catch event in an IEC application. This is done by registering a callback function to events.
 *	
 *	The example consists of this runtime component, a CODESYS library (CmpTemplateEventIEC.library), and a CODESYS test project (CmpTemplateEventIECTest.project).
 *	The runtime component creates the event at startup, and posts the event in the comm cycle.
 *	The CODESYS library defines event Ids and structures. This must correspond with the runtime component.
 *	The CODESYS test project is using the event by registering a callback function.
 *
 *	More examples about using events can be found in CmpTemplate and CmpTemplateEvent.
 *
 *	USAGE:
 *	- CAL_EventCreate2() must be called to register the callback function. IEC application can then call EventOpen and EventRegisterCallbackFunction.
 *	- CAL_EventClose() must be called to close the event	
 *	- CAL_EventPost() is called to post the event, and registered callback function will be called
