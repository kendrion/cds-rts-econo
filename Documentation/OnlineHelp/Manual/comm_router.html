<p>A router packet consists of a <strong>header</strong> and the actual message
(<strong>data</strong>). The length of the header is variable, since node addresses
have different lengths. Irrespective of this the data always start at a
4-byte limit within the packet. Correct alignment is therefore always
ensured, provided the data are structured accordingly.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the header structure:</p>
<img alt="../_images/comm_router_header_structure.png" src="../_images/comm_router_header_structure.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>HC/AdrOff: Depending on the hop count addressing type hop count
(direct addresses) or the address offset (relative addresses)</p></li>
<li><p>HL: Length of the static header in words. Corresponds to the offset
of ReceiverAdr. Currently 3, i.e. 6 bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>AdrType: 0 for direct addresses, 1 for relative</p></li>
<li><p>Prio: Packet priority: 0 low, 1 normal, 2 high, 3 emergency. Packets
with higher priority are given preference by routers.</p></li>
<li><p>SR: SignalRouter. Is set by a router to indicate en error (e.g. block
size).</p></li>
<li><p>BlkLen<sub>Max</sub>: Field for maximum block length. The maximum block
length is calculated as <em>(BlkLen:sub:`Max`+ 1)*32</em>. ( 0: 32 bytes,
1: 64 bytes, 2: 96 bytes, …, 15: 512 bytes)</p></li>
<li><p>ServiceId: A kind of port number for the called service.</p></li>
<li><p>MessageId: Is set by the sender. Is used for identification of a
message, detection of duplicates for unsecured services, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>SL: Length of the sender address in words</p></li>
<li><p>RL: Length of the receiver address in words.</p></li>
<li><p>Filler word: 0. Is inserted if SenderAdr does not end at a 4
byte-limit, in order to align the user data with a 4-byte limit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Minimum packet length (both addresses one word, no content): 12 bytes</p>
<div class="section" id="hop-count">
<h2>5.5.5.1. Hop count<a class="headerlink" href="#hop-count" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This field is initialized to 31 (the maximum number of nodes that a
packet has to pass through when the network reaches the maximum depth of
15). Each node that forwards a packet reduces the value of this field by
1. Once the field value has reached 0 the packet can no longer be
forwarded. The field also has to be decremented for broadcasts that are
forwarded to subnets.</p>
<p>This mechanism offers reliable protection from broadcast floods and
infinite packet loops, both for cycles and in the event of
misconfiguration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="router-signaling">
<h2>5.5.5.2. Router signaling<a class="headerlink" href="#router-signaling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This header flag identifies a message as a router message. If a router
is unable to deliver a message due to particular circumstances, it
generates a new message that is sent back to the sender of the original
message, which sets the router flag. The service ID is taken from the
undelivered packet, while bit 0 is toggled. A request thus becomes a
response and vice versa (see <a class="reference internal" href="ov_kernel_scheduling.html#timer-scheduler"><span class="std std-ref">ov_kernel_scheduling</span></a>). With separate client/server
implementation of a service this ensures that the sending component
receives the message back.</p>
<p>A router message contains the complete header of the discarded packet.
It also contains an ErrorId of the router and further, error-dependent
information. The original sender then forwards the packet to the
corresponding service as usual. Via a “MessageId” header field, which is
generated by the service when a message is sent, the returned message
can be assigned to a current request. The router can first analyze the
error itself and adapt internal information as required (e.g. the
maximum block length for a particular transmission route).</p>
<p>If a message with active router flag cannot be delivered it is discarded
without generating a further router message, in order to avoid endless
message floods.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Possible router messages:</div>
<div class="line">BLOCKLEN_OVERRUN: Maximum block length for a transmission route
exceeded.</div>
<div class="line">INVALID_SUBNET: The subnet for the next node does not exist.</div>
<div class="line">INVALID_NODE: Node does not exist (not detectable for all block
drivers).</div>
<div class="line">CONGESTION: Next transmission route blocked, but return channel is
available.</div>
<div class="line">INVALID_SERVICE: The specified ServiceId is not used on the target
computer.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="variable-maximum-block-length-for-a-transmission-route">
<h2>5.5.5.3. Variable maximum block length for a transmission route<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-maximum-block-length-for-a-transmission-route" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not all block drivers can send up to 512 bytes (the maximum size of a
router packet) in once piece. With many transmission protocols 512 bytes
no longer fit into 1, 2, .. frames, which means that for each packet an
additional, almost empty frame would have to be generated and sent,
resulting in useless overhead. This problem may arise for any fixed
block length. Shorter block lengths may therefore be selected, depending
on the transmission route (in steps of 32 bytes).</p>
<p>A field in the Level 3 header is reserved for the maximum block length
of the transmission route. In the absence of further information this
field is initialized with 512 bytes. Each router checks whether the next
transmission route has a smaller block length (information from block
driver) and updates the field as required. The header of the receiver
then contains the smallest maximum block length for the whole
communication path. If a packet cannot be forwarded due to excessive
block length, it is discarded and the problem is reported to the sender
via the signaling mechanism ( 5.5.2).</p>
<p>Router components should remember the values determined in this way, at
least for the last communication partners. Since the first packets
between two end points are generally relatively small packets (e.g.
connection setup, network scan, …) no packets should have to be
discarded due to this mechanism during normal operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-router-instances">
<h2>5.5.5.4. Multiple router instances<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-router-instances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Routers are Instantiable, i.e. for each device several router instances
can exist simultaneously. Each router exclusively manages part of the
block drivers, i.e. there is no joint block driver access. Each router
instance has its own main network configuration, and therefore has its
own address and forms its own (partial) network. There is no provision
for direct routing between router instances. Consequently, a router
instance always has to be specified in order to be able to send network
packets. Router instances are given a name for identification and are
addressed via an Id.</p>
<p>In order to keep the configuration simple, a default router is available
that can be used for standard communication. Further routers are
available for redundant network connections, service channels etc.</p>
<p>The default configuration of a router comprises a main network
connection but no subnets. Subnets have to be configured explicitly in
order to avoid problems.</p>
