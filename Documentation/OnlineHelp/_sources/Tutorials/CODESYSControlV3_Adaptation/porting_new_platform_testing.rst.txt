Testing the communication
-------------------------

-  | To test the communication basically, you should start with a very
     simple project with a cyclic counter:
   | |image11|

-  | Double click on the device in your device tree, and open the
     communication settings:
   | |image12|

-  | Set the “active path” to your PLC and try to log in. You should see
     the following dialog box:
   | |image13|
   | **Note:** If that dialog box doesn’t appear, you will most likely
     have an issue in SysTimeMyPlat.c: SysTimeGetMs(). Because this
     function is used to detect communication timeouts and if the
     timebase is wrong, this leads to such communication errors.

-  | If you say “Yes” in the previous dialog, you should see a progress
     bar in the status bar:
   | |image14|

-  | If everything worked fine, your project should now be successfully
     downloaded and your program should be in stop:
   | |image15|

-  If it didn’ work:

   -  | You get an error message **“Create Bootproject failed”**:
      | Try to logout and login again. If this works, you just have a
        problem with your flash driver. The PLC was unable to save the
        bootproject, but the application should run fine anyway.

   -  | You get an error message **“Communication Timeout”**:
      | Most likely your PLC crashed during download. You should attach
        your debugger, try again and have a look into section 2.3.
