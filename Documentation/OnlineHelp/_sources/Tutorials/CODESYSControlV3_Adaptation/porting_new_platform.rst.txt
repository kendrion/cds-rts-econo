Porting to a new Platform
=========================

This chapter describes the steps, starting from a plain delivery of a
CODESYS Control Starter Package, to a Runtime, which you are able to
login to with CODESYS. For simplicity, we start with a Compact Runtime
here. That means, that we strip out some advanced functionality from the
existing components by setting the pre-processor define „RTS_COMPACT“
and if there is an „Embedded-Version“ of a component, we favour this one
ahead the full-featured version. This way, we have the smallest possible
Runtime and we need to implement the smallest amount of system
components for the beginning.

If you need more features for your runtime, please check chapter 3 of
this document, to find out how to add some of the most essential
components to your runtime system.
