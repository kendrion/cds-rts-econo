Reference Implementations
-------------------------

In some cases, you will receive a reference implementation for your CPU
or for a specific Evaluation Board from your first level support of 3S â€“
Smart Software Solutions. Even in those cases, we recommend, that you
work yourself through this guide and just take this reference
implementation really as what it is: Just a reference.

Especially you should not assume that those implementations are
error-free or that they will work for your specific application. Their
aim is just to help you in the initial porting.
