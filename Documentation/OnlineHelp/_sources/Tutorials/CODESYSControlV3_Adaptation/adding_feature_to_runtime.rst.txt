Adding Features to the Runtime
==============================

One of the big advantages of the version 3.x of the CODESYS Control
Runtime in comparison to version 2 is the flexibility. We just started
with a Compact Runtime which provides only a very basic scheduler
(CmpScheduleEmbedded + CmpAppEmbedded), no I/O Drivers
(CmpIoMgrEmbedded), no Routing (CmpRouterEmbedded) and no Debugging
Support (no CmpAppBP, CmpAppForce).

But depending on our requirements, we can extend our runtime system very
easily by exchanging some components or adding others to our system.

We are using the RtsConfigurator again for this task, because it helps
us resolving all necessary dependencies and sets the correct defines in
compact.h and compact_NotImpl.h. With every Feature which is described
in this chapter, we are starting again with a plain Compact Runtime.
