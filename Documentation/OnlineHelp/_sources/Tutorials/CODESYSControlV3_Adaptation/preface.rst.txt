Preface
=======

This document describes the basic approach to port the CODESYS Control
runtime system to a bare hardware without an operating system, as well
as to a platform with an unsupported operating system. This is a
practical document and does not describe the concepts behind CODESYS
Control or I/O Drivers. To learn more about the concepts and special
implementation details, please refer to the document
*CODESYSControlV3_Manual.pdf* which is delivered with every CODESYS
Control SDK.

For systems with proprietary operating systems as well as for small
embedded systems, we will start with a very small, stripped down
configuration of CODESYS Control which is called “Compact Runtime”. This
term describes only a minimal set of components with a limited
configuration which is necessary for communicating with CODESYS and to
run an application on it.

The reason for this is just, that we have the least amount of adaptation
work to do in the system layer to get this working. If you need more
functionality, you can configure one component after another into the
system. This way, the functionality which you need to implement will
grow linearly and you can more easily implement and test one after
another. This reduces the complexity of this porting task drastically.
