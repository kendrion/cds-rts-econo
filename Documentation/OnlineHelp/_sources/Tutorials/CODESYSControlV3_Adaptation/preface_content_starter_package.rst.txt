Content of the Starter Package
------------------------------

The base for this porting is a Starter Package of CODESYS Control for an
“embedded” or “customer specific” platform. This Starter Package
contains all sources of the CODESYS Control runtime system. It contains
no platform dependant adaptation layer for your or any other CPU or
platform.

For some platforms, 3S – Smart Software Solutions provides reference
implementations. For those it is possible to receive a package from your
first level support. He can give you the most current files which should
fit your environment and requirements best.
