Version Control System
----------------------

We strongly recommend you to use some kind of Version Control System,
like “Subversion”, “ClearCase” or “git” to maintain the changes
to runtime system. It will help you to keep track of your own changes in
the beginning of the project and it will essentially support you if you
wan to update your runtime to a newer version at a later time.

Within this document, we will give you some hints on where you should
check in the current state of the sources. If possible with your version
control system you should even tag those versions, that it’s easier to
find those revisions later.

But if you follow our Coding Guidelines, you don’t need to care too much
about those tags. Because then, you just need to copy the new files from
your new CODESYS Control starter package over the existing files and see
the differences in the “SysTemplates” folder. Then you just need to make
all those adaptations to your own platform files and you are fine.
