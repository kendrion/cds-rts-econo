Target Settings for the device description
==========================================

Enable Trace Manager
--------------------

An entry in the device description file defines whether the device will
use the functionality of the trace manager or of the internal IEC trace.

For using the Trace Manager, the ``CmpTraceMgr`` must be integrated in the
runtime system and the following target setting must be added to the
device description:

::

 <section name="trace">
  <setting name="tracemanager" type="boolean" access="visible">
 	<value>1</value>
  <setting>
 </section>

System Tasks
------------

Additionally, task names for using system tasks as trace tasks can be defined In the
target description. Then the names are available in the configuration
dialog of the programming system for configuring a trace packet:

::

 <ts:section name="trace">
 â€¦
   <ts:setting name="systemtasks" type="string" access="visible">
 	<ts:value>SystemTask1,SystemTask2,SystemTask3</ts:value>
   </ts:setting>
 </ts:section>
