Overview
========

| The trace functionality is provided with the 'Trace Editor' in CODESYS.
  It allows to capture the progression of the values of variables on the
  PLC over a certain time, similar to a digital sampling oscilloscope.
  Additionally a trigger can be set to control the data capturing with
  input (trigger) signals. The values of trace variables are steadily
  written to a CODESYS buffer of a specified size. The values then can be
  observed in form of a two-dimensional graph plotted as a function of
  time.

For how to configure a trace please see the CODESYS Help.

The Trace Manager *CmpTraceMgr* is a component of the runtime system
CODESYS Control V3. This component handles all kind of traces
and trace configurations.

The Trace Manager has an enhanced functionality. It is possible...

-  to configure and trace parameters of the control system (like the
   temperature curve of the CPU or the battery)
-  to read out device traces (like the trace of the electric current of
   a drive)
-  to trace system variables of other runtime system components.

A trace configuration is called a “\ *trace packet*\ ”. A single
variable inside a trace packet is called a “\ *trace record*\ ” (which
is stored in a data set that consists of a value and the corresponding
timestamp of the shot).

A trace record can be an IEC variable, a system variable or an
I/O configuration variable. So, for example dynamical values like the current
values of a drive, can be stored in a record.

Every component (runtime or IEC) can define a trace packet resp. a trace
configuration. The trace editor integrated in CODESYS uses the same
component for storing and managing the user traces.

The trace editor in the CODESYS programming system can display all
registered trace packets. For this you can use the upload command in the Trace menu to display all stored traces configurations in the runtime system.

The trace configuration and the values can be stored in a file. This
feature is called “\ *persistent trace*\ ”. So, after a reboot of the controller,
the persistent trace configuration will automatically be loaded and
restarted.
