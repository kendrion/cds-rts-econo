Handle the TargetIDs and Signatures
===================================

Every derivate of your targets will need to have their own TargetID. The
TargetID is used to have a clear linkage between your device Description
and your Target Runtime. So every time you need to make a change in the
device description for a new target, you will need to request a new
TargetID from 3S.

This is necessary, because one part of the target signature is the
TargetID. So, you will most likely need a new signature, too.

If you have a huge amount of targets, you might like to manage them with
the same target signature. In this case, you can request a range of
signatures from 3S. Then you will get a new targetdefines.h which
contains a new Signature in combination with a Device Mask. This is then
valid for a specific range of TargetIDs.

To include the new targetdefines.h in your system, you need to recompile the runtime or use the
component :ref:`group___sys_target_o_e_m` as an addon fo a binary runtime.
