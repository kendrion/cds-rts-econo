Manage the License Files
========================

Every field bus that you are using on your PLC, needs to have a valid
license from 3S. Additionally there are a few features, like the Target
Visualization or Soft Motion, which are secured by a license on the
target.

All those licenses are contained in a file, called 3S.dat. This file
needs to be accessible from IEC on your target. You can do this like
this:

  | [SysFile]
  | FilePath.1=ide0:/root

Alternatively, you can place only files with the extension \*.dat to a
special folder:

  | [SysFile]
  | FilePath.1=ide0:/root
  | FilePath.2=ide0:/license, \*.dat

If you have an embedded system, where you don’t have a file system, but
you are using SysFileFlash to manage your files, you can use the tool
„ConvertFileToArray“, which you will find in the CODESYS Control
Delivery. This tool will output a C-Preprocessor define, that you can
copy to your „sysdefines.h“. Just name the define like this:

  | #define LICENSEFILE_DAT {\\
  | 0xd0,0x4e,0x7f,0x23,0xe6,0xba,0x82,0xa3,0xf8,0x22,\\
