CODESYS Control Scheduler
=========================

.. _tutorial_scheduler:

The scheduler of the runtime system is responsible for:

    1. Scheduling all IEC tasks (except "ExternalEvent" and "Freewheeling" tasks)
    
    2. Supervising all IEC tasks (watchdog)
    
The scheduler is implemented by the :ref:`group___cmp_schedule_itf` interface.

Currently there are 3 different implementations of the scheduler with different features. Every schedule contains a chapter "Use cases" to describe typical configuration settings
for different use cases and requirements.
