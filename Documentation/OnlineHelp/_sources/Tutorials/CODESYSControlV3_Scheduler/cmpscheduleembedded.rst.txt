CmpScheduleEmbedded
===================

Introduction
------------

The embedded scheduler can be used on controllers without an operating system and without the availability of a CPU timer!

The scheduling is done without an external timer event. The CPU is just polling for communication events or for an IEC
“task” which needs to be executed and executes it if the time has come.

.. note::

    This is the worst way to schedule IEC tasks and so check before, if the features :ref:`feature_schedule_timer` or :ref:`feature_schedule_full` 
    cannot be used instead!

:ref:`feature_schedule_embedded`

Cooperative scheduling
----------------------

This is the only implemented scheduling mechanism of this feature / component! So all IEC tasks are scheduled in the order of their priority
(from highest to lowest), one after the other without interrrupting each other!

This means:

-  As long as an IEC task is running, the communication hangs completely

-  The IEC tasks cannot interrupt each other

-  If one communication cycle takes a bit longer it can produce a jitter for the start of the IEC task.

So in fact this scheduler can handle multiple, periodic IEC tasks but it is non deterministic.
