CmpScheduleTimer
================

Introduction
------------

The timer scheduler can be used on controllers without an operating system, but with the support of CPU timers! You can use these timers to schedule IEC tasks in a very exact time interval
of a CPU timer.

This scheduler fits well on small embedded systems, that provide more
than one timer. So it is possible to setup multiple periodic IEC tasks
on different timers. Therefore it is possible that a higher priority
timer interrupts a lower priority one. Furthermore, the communication is
running in a background loop and cannot harm the execution of the IEC
tasks.

You can use one high priority timer to supervise all IEC tasks. The following settings are used to configure this feature (see :ref:`group___cmp_schedule_itf`:

- SCHEDULETIMERKEY_USE_WATCHDOG_TIMER

- CMPSCHEDULETIMER_WATCHDOG_PRIORITY

- CMPSCHEDULETIMER_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL
