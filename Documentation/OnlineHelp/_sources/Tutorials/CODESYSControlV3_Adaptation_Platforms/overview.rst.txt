Overview
========

For OEM manufacturers, the CODESYS Control runtime system is not a
ready-to-use product. It is a toolkit that has to be adapted by the OEM.

An OEM who wants to use the CODESYS Control runtime system has to
provide some prerequisites before the adaption begins, and has to finish
the adaptation after the workshop provided by 3S–Smart Software
Solutions (in the following called 3S).

In the workshop, the OEM learns about how to adapt and extend the
runtime, but the result of the workshop is not a finished PLC product.

3S assists the OEM by telephone and email support in case questions
arise after the workshop.

On request, 3S can help with the OEM’s work packages of adaptation and
test; 3S will estimate the effort and send quotations for the customer
specific service.
