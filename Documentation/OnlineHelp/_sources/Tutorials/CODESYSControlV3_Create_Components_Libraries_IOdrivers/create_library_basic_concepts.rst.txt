Basic Concepts
==============

Please also look into CODESYSControlV3_Manual, chapter 10.5 Libraries.

CODESYS libraries can contain “internal” and “external” functions.
Internal functions are implemented in IEC code and do not require any
extension of the runtime system. External functions are implemented in C
code. They are implemented inside a runtime system component.

The following drawing illustrates the structure of a runtime component
implementing some external library functions:

This is an extension of the concept explained in chapter 2.

The CODESYS library contains the interfaces of the external functions.
Using the menu command “Generate runtime system files”, CODESYS will
create

-  definitions that will be part of the Itf.m4 file, and

-  code that can be used as a template for the C implementation.

This helps to create components that contain the C functions exactly
matching the interfaces defined in IEC..
