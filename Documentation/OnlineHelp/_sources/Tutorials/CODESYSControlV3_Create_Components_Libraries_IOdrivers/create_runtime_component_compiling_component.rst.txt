Compiling a Component
---------------------

To compile the component you need to create a makefile or project for
your C compiler. This is highly system/toolchain specific.

You also have to add compiler defines and include paths.

A step by step instruction for various operating systems can be found in
chapter “Appendix B: Step by Step: Compiling a component”
