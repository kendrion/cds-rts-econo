Component based Architecture
----------------------------

The runtime system is component based. There is one specific component
in the runtime system, which is called the component manager. It is in
charge of initializing the components.

Every component must have some component frame code. This is a set of
functions, called by the component manager. Most of these functions are
used for initialization.

The functions are

-  ComponentEntry

-  ExportFunctions

-  ImportFunctions

-  CmpGetVersion

-  HookFunction.

Most of these functions make use of predefined macros, so you do not
need to care about the implementation. You can re-use the implementation
from the template components that are part of the runtime toolkit
delivery.

**When starting to write a component, use the template components
provided in the toolkit as a starting point.**

Probably, you will want to add your own init code into HookFunction.

In the following, we call these functions “component frame code”.
