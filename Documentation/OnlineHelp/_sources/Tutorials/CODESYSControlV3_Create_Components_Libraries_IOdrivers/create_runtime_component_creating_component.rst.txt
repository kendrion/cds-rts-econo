Creating a Component
--------------------

Please also look into CODESYSControlV3_Manual, chapter 10.3 Implementing
own components.

To create a new component, start with a template component provided in
the runtime toolkit delivery. We recommend starting with one of these
templates:

-  CmpTemplate: Quite complex template with examples for various runtime
   mechanisms and common functionalities

-  CmpTemplateEmpty: Minimal template component, without example code
   (only empty component frame)

-  CmpTemplateEvent: Minimal template component, with example code how
   to react on runtime system events

-  CmpTemplateEventIEC: Minimal template component, with example code
   how to create runtime system event, and how to react in IEC code.

Copy the template and adjust the file names, component name, vendor id
and version. A Python script (gen_cmp_from_temp.py) is provided that can
help you with this task.

A step by step instruction is given in chapter “Appendix A: Step by
Step: Creating a new component”.
