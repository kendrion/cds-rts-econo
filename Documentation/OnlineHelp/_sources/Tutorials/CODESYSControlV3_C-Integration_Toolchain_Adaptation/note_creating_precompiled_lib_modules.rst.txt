Note for creating precompiled library modules and distributing them as part of IEC libraries
============================================================================================

For this use case it is not necessary to create an AP Plug-In supporting
a certain compiler toolchain. The compiled component can be created
through the usual C development workflows.

There are two important constraints to consider though when compared to
a regular runtime system component:

1. The created component may only export functions marked as externally
   implemented library functions (the default setting when exporting an
   IEC interface to M4/C in CODESYS)

2. The names of the C functions must bear the string “_cext” in their
   name. Otherwise the component manager will refuse to make the
   functions from the modules loaded by the C-Integration available to
   other components and applications. This is a security feature.
