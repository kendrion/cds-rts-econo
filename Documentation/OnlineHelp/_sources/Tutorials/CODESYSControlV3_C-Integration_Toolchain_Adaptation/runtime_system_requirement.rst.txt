Runtime System Requirements
===========================

The runtime system does not require any additional customization for
specific devices for the C-Integration to work.

The following prerequisites must be fulfilled:

1. Operating system have to support dynamically loadable modules:
   For example Windows, Windows CE, Linux, VxWorks and QNX supports dynamically loadable modules.

2. Runtime system version must be at least v3.5.7.0!

3. Runtime system must be compiled as MIXED_LINK (with STATIC_LINK the C-Integration is not working!)

4. Entry in 3S.dat to license the feature for the device is needed:
   License = "C-Integration"

5. OPTIONAL:
   If a user management is active on the device, the developer of a C-module must have the "Modify" right on the "Device.PlcLogic.<Application>.__C-ModuleIntegration__" object.
