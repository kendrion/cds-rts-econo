Security considerations
=======================

Before enabling the C-Integration on PLC runtimes there are certain
security considerations to be made. Read the following notices carefully
and be sure to understand the consequences before actually enabling this
feature for PLCs.

Since a C Integration Module is mostly loaded like any other runtime
component, it makes its API visible and accessible through the component
manager. It will not be possible though to override any other system
functions exported by other runtime components. It will also not be
possible to override any other externally implemented IEC library
functions.

This is achieved by marking C Modules as such for the component manager.
This allows the component manager to implement strict policies regarding
the handling of API functions exported by Modules from the C
Integration.

Nevertheless this feature will enable users to easily write and execute
C code on the PLC which has full access to the OS and system library
APIs. This means for example that accessing files can be done without
the wrapping layer of SysFile by directly using OS functions. Runtime
settings like the IecFilePath will not affect this file access and users
will be able to work outside of any sandboxes defined.
