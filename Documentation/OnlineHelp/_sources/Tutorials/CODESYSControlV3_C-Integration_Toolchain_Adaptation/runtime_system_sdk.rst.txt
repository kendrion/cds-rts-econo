Runtime system SDK
==================

Building a dynamic object loadable by the CODESYS runtime requires a set
of tools and headers referred to as an SDK.The common storage for this
SDKs is the folder named C-Integration the installation root folder of
CODESYS.

Folder layout
-------------

Every PlugIn uses its own subfolder and must use the Guid of the
ComponentBuilder instance as folder name. If different device versions
are to be supported, it is recommended to group the versions by folders.

Eventually a certain layout of an SDK folder is expected. The folder
**Components** should contain the headers of runtime components either
required for building a dynamic object or which are additionally
selectable by the user for usage in their code. The folder **Platforms**
contains architecture and OS specific headers.

User selectable runtime system components
-----------------------------------------

The runtime system components selectable by user for usage in their code
through the configuration editor in CODESYS are acquired through the
IBuildConfiguration interface.The property
**AvailableRuntimeComponents** returns a list of all components visible
to the user.

The list returned by the property can either be hardcoded or parsed from
configuration files. The implementation details are left open. The
reference implementation parses an XML file to get the list of the
components.
