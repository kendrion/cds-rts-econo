Enabling C Integration
======================

The C Integration in CODESYS is split into two parts. CODESYS itsself
takes care of all steps required to setup and coordinate the building of
a C source code component in your project. The end result will be a
dynamically linkable runtime module specific to your runtime
environment.

For the actual compilation and creation of that module CODESYS must rely
on external tools. There is no C Compiler or linker available in
CODESYS.

Enabling the C Integration for a device in a project requires the
following steps:

1. | Creating a Plug-In which implements the toolchain specific build
     actions for your target device.
   | Especially there must be an implementation of the interface
     ICSourceComponentBuilder available.

2. Adding a reduced Runtime system SDK to your setup specific to the
   devices supported by the C-Integration

Whenever a C module is to be compiled, an instance of the
ICSourceComponentBuilder is created. The remaining document describes
implementation details for the Plug-In.
