Introduction
============

| CODESYS V3 provides a generic CAN L2 (CL2) layer for accessing the
  CANbus.
| It implements hardware-independent functions for both sending and
  receiving messages and CANbus diagnosis. These functions are
  accessible from C as well as IEC. All CAN-based I/O drivers (e.g.
  CANopen Stack, J1939 Stack) are based on this layer.
| The concrete access to the respective CAN chip is implemented by
  CANMiniDrivers. At runtime start, a CANMiniDriver registers each CAN
  interface at the CL2 layer.
| Here a unique Network ID will be assigned and used for addressing the
  interface later.
| CODESYS V3 already provides ready-to-use CANMiniDriver implementations
  for SJA 1000 (RTE), PCAN Basic (Control Win), SocketCAN (Linux), and
  EL6751 (EtherCAT/CAN Gateway).
| For other CAN chips and platforms, a specific CANMiniDriver component
  has to be implemented.
| This document serves as an implementation guideline for CANMiniDrivers
  and describes basic concepts.
