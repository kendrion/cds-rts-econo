Overview
--------

There are two test procedures available: a semi-automatic CANMiniDriver
Conformance Test and a manual CAN Echo test.

| **Q:** Which test should I use?
| **A:** The semi-automatic test needs a Peak CAN Interface (e.g. PCAN
  USB dongle) for testing. If you have this kind of interface (e.g. PCAN
  USB dongle), then we recommend using the automatic test.
| Otherwise you can use the old-style CAN Echo Test. Therefore, only a
  CAN Analyzer with message sending functionality is required.
