Important Runtime Defines
=========================

There are some important runtime defines that can be adapted to optimize
the memory usage and behavior of a CAN runtime system (see
CAADefinesGeneric.h).

| **CL2_NNET:** Maximum number of CAN interfaces. If your runtime has a
  maximum number of 2 CAN interfaces and there should be no support for
  other CAN drivers, then set this define to 2 to optimize the memory
  footprint.
| Default: 2
| **CL2_NRXMSG:** Default number of initially allocated receive messages
  per driver instance. Will be used if driver calls CmdRegister with
  ctMessages = 0.
| Default: 100

| **CL2_QUEUE_ADAPTION:** If set to true, then the number of receive
  messages will automatically extended if receive message handles are
  running short. It is recommended to activate this feature. Otherwise
  there could be lost receive messages.
| Default: 1
| **CL2_NDRV_CTX:** Number of driver contexts which should be allocated
  in static memory. Each DriverOpenH needs one driver context. Set this
  define to a number greater or equal 0. If number of driver context is
  not sufficient DriverOpenH will allocate further memory.
| Default: 0

| **CL2_NREVENTTABLE:** Number of Event Tables (round about 16k per
  table) which should be allocated in static memory. An event table is
  only required if CAA Callback is present and application uses receiver
  events (Fieldbus stacks work without events). At most one Event Table
  per physical CAN network (CL2_NNET) is required. If not enough memory
  is allocated in static memory, memory will be allocated dynamically
  when application uses events the first time (CreateReceiver with
  eEvent != 0).
| Default: 0
| **CL2_NPRIO:** Number of message priorities supported by CL2. For
  fieldbus stacks only 3 priorities are required!
| Default: 8
| **CL2_SZRIDP:** Receiver context pool size in byte. Each receiver
  needs one receiver context with roundabout 32 byte on 32 bit targets.
  If more receivers are created, memory will be dynamically extended.
| Default: 2048 (32 bit), 4096 (64 bit)

| **CL2_SZRECEIVER_QUEUE:** Static memory for receiver queues in byte.
  Each receiver with xAlwaysNewest=FALSE needs one receiver queue with
  roundabout 44 byte on 32 bit targets. If more receivers with queue are
  created, memory will be dynamically extended.
| Default: 2048 (32 bit), 4096 (64 bit)
| **CL2_CALLBACK:** Enables the callback support of CL2. You can disable
  this for saving memory as it is not used by our CAN-based stacks (see
  also CL2_NREVENTTABLE).
| Default: depends on availability of CAA_CB
