Exception Info
==============

This feature has two effects on platforms, where a stack frame in the runtime code is not available! This is typically the case on ARM CPUs!

These are the two effects on external library calls:

1. Callstack is available at an exception on an external library call

2. If a watchdog exception occurs on an external library call, we have the possibility with the callstack to run gracefully out of the external
   library call!

   .. note::
      This is an important aspect, because the runtime system remains in a consistent condition after a watchdog exception in IEC program!
