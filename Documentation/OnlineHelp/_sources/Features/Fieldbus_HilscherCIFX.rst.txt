Hilscher CIFX
=============

With this feature you can support Hilscher cifX cards (https://www.hilscher.com/products/product-groups/pc-cards) or netX controller (https://www.hilscher.com/products/product-groups/network-controller)
plugged in your controller.

The hilscher devices supports various fieldbus protocols and standards and can be used in a variety of form factors.

The IO-drivers that supports such devices are available as IEC IO-drivers and are using the CmpHilscherCIFX component in the runtime system. So this component is needed in the 
runtime system to support this feature:

The component itself contains the hilscher cifx toolkit, which does the exchange with the physical cifX or netX device.
