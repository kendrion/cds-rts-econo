Trace
=====

In CODESYS there is an oscilloscope feature to record IEC variable values over a timeline. This feature is called a Trace and is implemented in the TraceManager component in the runtime system (CmpTraceMgr). .
You can configure some IEC variables in a so called Trace configuration (TracePacket). One variable to record is called a TraceRecord.

So this feature description contains all necessary aspects to activate the Trace functionality. 
There is a separate :ref:`tutorial_trace_manager` that explains several details of the trace manager.
