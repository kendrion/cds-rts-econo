
_`SecurityManager`
==================

The SecurityManager controls all current available security features via security settings.

Security settings
-----------------

Within a set of security levels the level of the highest security is always at the first position. The levels are in descending order. The default level represents the most tolerant setting.

If the compile switch CMPSECURITYMANAGER_SET_SECURITY_LEVEL_MAXIMUM is defined, the SecurityManager advises all components to use the highest security level instead of the default one.
See in the chapter "Security settings" of each feature the corresponding security settings.

The security manager setting "CreateAllOnStartup" (see :ref:`group___cmp_security_manager_itf`) can be activated in the runtime cfg-file. With this setting the following certificates 
and keys are created during startup:

- CmpSecureChannel: Create a selfsigned certificate

- CmpWebserver: Create a selfsigned certificate

- CmpOpenSSL: Create Diffie Hellman parameters

Requirements
------------

The following runtime system components are necessary for this feature:

- CmpSecurityManager: :ref:`group___cmp_security_manager_itf`
