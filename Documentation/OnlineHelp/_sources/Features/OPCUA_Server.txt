=============

Overview
--------

The OPC UA Server exposes variables configured in the symbolic configuration
of the CODESYS project to the OPC UA address space. Clients can read, write
and monitor the values of the PLC.
To enable the OPC UA support in the CODESYS IDE the option "Support OPC UA Features"
must be set in the Symbolconfiguration.

Currently the OPC UA server supports the "Micro Embedded Device Server Profile".
This server profile allows reading, writing, and subscribing of items. Security features
such as encrypted communication and user management are currently not supported. 

OPC UA allows defining different data types. The combination of customer
defined data types, object types and reference types allows defining your own
information model. An information model describes how the data should be 
exposed to the address space. By now only the basic information model is 
provided. The PLCopen information model is planned for one of the 
next service packs. It is possible to add an own information model to the
OPC UA Server. To extend the OPC UA server with your specific information 
model and your specific data it is required to implement the Provider 
interface which is described in the next chapter.


Provider Interface
------------------
The provider interface is used to add nodes to the address space of the
OPC UA server. The server itself doesn't provide any nodes. The basic nodes
are already defined in an own provider. The server itself does as much 
preprocessing as possible to identify errors in the requests of the client.
After these checks have been done the server calls all registered providers
to get the data to be sent to the client.

The subscriptions work slightly different. The server does the complete
handling of the subscriptions and monitored items. The provider is only
responsible to sample the item if the sampling interval exceeds. All
additional processing (filtering, buffering, publishing) is done by the server.

A detailed  description of the provider interface can be found in the 
corresponding header file (see: OpcUaProvider.h). As a short overview these
are the functions of the provider interface:

- Initialization and clean up
- CreateMonitoredItem
- SampleMonitoredItem
- DeleteMonitoredItem
- Read
- Write
- Browse

Server Interface
----------------

A server interface is provided for interactions with the OPC UA server. This interface allows the following
operations:

- Get the index of the given namespace
- Register a new namespace to the server
- Load an information model out of a XML file. The XML file has to follow the
OPC UA UANodeset.xsd schema. The schema can be found at: http://www.opcfoundation.org/UA/schemas/1.02/UANodeSet.xsd


Platforms
---------

The OPC UA server works on all platforms matching the minimum requirements.
The runtime system must include all required components. Because OPC UA 
moves a lot of logic of the client into the server platforms the OPC UA server
may cause a high CPU load. Devices with slow processors aren't able to run
the OPC UA server. The RAM footprint of a runtime with OPC UA is nearly doubled.

Configuration File
------------------

To configure the behaviour of the OPC UA server there are some entries in
the CODESYSControl configuration file. For details see the CmpOPCUAServer
interface description (see :ref:`group___cmp_o_p_c_u_a_server_itf`).

Restrictions
------------
- No user management is available. 

Security
--------
The availble security features of the OPC UA server are documented in :ref:`opcua_server_security`.

Requirements
------------

Additionally the OPC UA server requires the following components of the runtime system:

- SysTarget
- CmpIecVarAccess
- CmpApp
