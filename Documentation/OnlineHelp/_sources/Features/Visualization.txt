Overview
========

| The user interfaces created in CODESYS can be used in different display variants, depending on which are supported by the controller that is being used.

Display variant integrated in the CODESYS Development System
============================================================

| The integrated visualization in the CODESYS Development System is perfect for application tests, service or diagnosis purposes, as well as for commissioning a system. As soon as the user is connected to the controller, the interface editor switches to an animated display of the elements. This variant is part of the free CODESYS Development System and is always applicable, regardless of which controller is being used.
| No runtime system components are necessary for this display variant.

CODESYS HMI \- System-wide access to process values
==================================================

| The user interfaces created with CODESYS are displayed on a detached display device. This eliminates the computational load on the controller. Communication with the controller is realized via the CODESYS Datasource. The datasource uses the same communication mechanisms as used for monitoring in the CODESYS Development System.
| This variant is perfect for operating and monitoring the machine on site and it also allows the values of multiple controllers to be displayed in one visualization. The visualization is displayed on one or several control panels without controller functionality or I/O-control. Apart from Windows PCs, operator devices with different operating-system-platforms can be used.
| CODESYS HMI is a visualization runtime that allows you to view visualization data from one or more remote devices. 

CODESYS TargetVisu \- Machine and system operation on site
=========================================================

| This platform-independent variant shows the user interfaces directly on the controller: on an integrated or a connected display. As such, the controller and the visualization are combined on a single device perfect for operating and monitoring machines and systems.

CODESYS WebVisu \- Service and diagnosis through worldwide access
================================================================

| The web-based display variant of the CODESYS Visualization enables remote access, remote monitoring, and service and diagnosis of a system over the internet. A standard web-browser communicates with the web-server in the controller via JavaScript and displays the visualization by means of HTML5. This technology is supported by nearly all browsers, and is therefore also available on devices with iOs or Android.

CODESYS Remote TargetVisu \- A remote variant of the TargetVisu 
================================================================

| CODESYS Remote TargetVisu is a visualization runtime that allows the visualization data to be displayed on any device with a native remote target visu client application. Communication with the controller is via TCP/IP.
