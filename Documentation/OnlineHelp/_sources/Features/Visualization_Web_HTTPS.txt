
HTTPS support for the web visualization
=======================================

This feature enables the SSL encryption support for the web visualization (https). An X.509 certificate for TLS Web Server Authentication is necessary.

Security settings
-----------------
The webserver registers a number of security settings to change the security configuration. See: :ref:`group___cmp_web_server_itf___security_settings`

Requirements
------------

The following runtime system components are necessary for this feature:

- CmpSecurityManager: :ref:`group___cmp_security_manager_itf`                
- `OpenSSL <tag_openssl_>`_ or equivalent crypto component
- CmpWebServer must be available. This can be enabled with the feature "Visualization_Web", but must be purchased previously by the OEM customer!
