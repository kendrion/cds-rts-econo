CODESYS Redundancy allows connecting two CODESYS PLCs to create one redundant system. Two PLCs are running the same application and if one of them fails the other one takes over the control without interrupting the control of the process.
Both PLCs are executing the same application, but only the active one is driving the outputs. Both PLCs are connected with a communication link, used for synchronization and data exchange. The standby PLC is reading inputs and executing the program, so the internal states of the application are identical. This allows switchover in a short time, typically between two PLC cycles.
The CODESYS Redundancy consists of
    •  a runtime component as extension of the CODESYS runtime system
    •  a library allowing to access runtime component functions
    •  a plug-in as extension of the CODESYS programming system
The runtime component is responsible for the synchronization of the two PLCs, using messages sent over the redundancy communication link. A separate runtime component implements this communication link, usually over TCP and UDP messages.
The library is an external library, allowing that functions of the runtime component can be called from the user application and from code generated by the PlugIn.
The PlugIn offers editor pages to set parameters like timeouts, and allows transmitting these parameters to the PLCs. The PlugIn also automatically generates implicit functions calls needed for the synchronization of the two PLCs.
