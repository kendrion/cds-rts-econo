SysCpuHandling implementation notes
-----------------------------------

- SysCpuGetInstancePointer():

Function to get the instance pointer on the basis of the base pointer. Both the instance pointer and the base pointer are only valid and used in the CODESYS application context. 
The offset is specific to the platform and is 8 byte for the C167 codegenerator.

An example implementation may be found in Platforms/SysTemplates/Sys/SysCpuHandlingOS.c of the runtime system toolkit.
