_`MultiCore Support`
====================

General Information
===================
With this feature the support of a CPU with multiple cores is enabled (SMP -  Symmetrical Multi Processor system). This feature depends additionally on the operating system, 
that supports multicore CPUs.
For detailled information on the multicore solution please look into the `MultiCore-Tutorial`_.

.. _`MultiCore-Tutorial`: ../_downloads/CODESYSControlV3_MultiCore.pdf    

Prerequisites
=============

1. The multicore feature of the runtime system is only available for operating systems which has a fully built in SMP support! See the `MultiCore-Tutorial`_ for details.

2. The runtime system component **SysCpuMultiCore** (interface :ref:`group___sys_cpu_multi_core_itf`) is required for the multicore support and is added by this feature to your runtime configuration!    

   For additional information for the the component look into:

   - :ref:`group___sys_cpu_multi_core_dep`

TargetSettings
==============

All necessary target settings for multicore support are predefined correctly in this feature. This are the necessary target settings.

1. To generally specify multicore support of a target, you have to specify:

   - :ref:`runtime_features_support-multicore`

2. To enable for an end user to change the cpu core binding of IEC-tasks via taskgrous in the taskconfiguration, you have to set the following setting in your device description:

   - :ref:`taskconfiguration_taskgroups_taskgroups-editable`

   Which goup bindings and cores are selectable in the IEC taskgroups can be specified in the following setting:

   - :ref:`taskconfiguration_multicore-cores`
