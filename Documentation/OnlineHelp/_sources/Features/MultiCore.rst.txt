_`MultiCore Support`
====================

General Information
...................

With this feature the support of a CPU with multiple cores is enabled (SMP -  Symmetrical Multi Processor system). This feature depends additionally on the operating system, 
that supports multicore CPUs.
For detailled information on the multicore solution please look into the :ref:`tutorial_multicore`.

Prerequisites
.............

1. The multicore feature of the runtime system is only available for operating systems which has a fully built in SMP support! See the :ref:`tutorial_multicore` for details.

2. The platform specific runtime system component **SysCpuMultiCore** is required for the multicore support and is added by this feature to your runtime configuration!    

3. Multi-core safe atomic operations implemented by the the runtime system component **SysCpuHandling** are required for full multi-core support.
