
Operation Mode
==============

The operation mode describes the global operation mode of a PLC. By default a PLC is in debug mode. In this mode all online operations like download, debugging and so on are allowed. 
Other modes restrict some online services to prevent unintended changes by the user on a running machine.

If this feature is enabled in the device description, the end user can specify the operation mode in the programming system with the menu commands “Online” / “Operating Mode”.    

Here the available operation modes:

- DEBUG: Device is in debug mode: All operations are allowed
- LOCKED [optional]: Device is locked: Previously set breakpoints and forced variables are further active, (file-)download and OnlineChange is blocked. NOTE: Target setting “locked_mode_supported” must be enabled in the device description of the target to use this feature!
- OPERATIONAL: Device is operational: Debug, force, (file-)download and OnlineChange actions are blocked. This should be the operation mode of a machine in the production process! NOTE: Target setting “operational_mode_supported” must be enabled in the device description of the target to use this feature!  

NOTE: To change the operation mode online on the controller, the onlineuser need the MODIFY right on the "Device" node (typically Administrator rights)!    

---------------------

NOTE: This feature must be activated in the device description of a target with the following target settings:

- :ref:`runtime_features_operational_mode_supported`: Enables generally using the operation mode

- :ref:`runtime_features_locked_mode_supported`: Enables the optional LOCKED mode

---------------------

This feature is implemented in the following component (see "Device operation mode"):

- CmpDevice: implements interface :ref:`group___cmp_device_itf`
