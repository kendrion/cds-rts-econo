Trace
=====

In CODESYS there is an oscilloscope feature to record IEC variable values over a timeline. This feature is called a Trace and is implemented in the TraceManager component in the runtime system (CmpTraceMgr). .
You can configure some IEC variables in a so called Trace configuration (TracePacket). One variable to record is called a TraceRecord.

So this feature description contains all necessary aspects to activate the Trace functionality. 
There is a separate tutorial that explains several details of the TraceManagerManual_.

---------------------

The following target settings are necessary for this feature:

- :ref:`trace_tracemanager`

- :ref:`trendrecording_disabled`

---------------------

The runtime system component CmpTraceMgr which implements the interface :ref:`group___cmp_trace_mgr_itf` is necessary for this feature. So this component
must be integrated in the runtime system:

- :ref:`group___cmp_trace_mgr_dep`
