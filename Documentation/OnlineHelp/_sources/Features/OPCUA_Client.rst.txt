OPC UA Client
=============

.. contents::
    :local:
    :depth: 1

Overview
--------

The OPC UA client can be used to connect to other OPC UA servers and exchange
data with them. The client itself is more like an SDK. There are no ready to
use types of clients. Instead the client provides an API to connect to
an OPC UA server and execute the different kind of OPC UA requests. An
exception to this is the handling of subscriptions and monitored items.
There are services to add and remove subscriptions as well as monitored
items. The complete publishing is then handled by the client implementation
automatically. Additionally the client detects connection interrupts on it's own
and tries to reconnect to the server. However, if the session has a timeout,
a reconnect is not done automatically.

Supported features
------------------

The OPC UA client actually is a counterpart to the OPC UA server. This 
results in the following supported services:

Discovery
~~~~~~~~~

- GetEndpoints
- FindServers
- FindServersOnNetwork

Session
~~~~~~~

- CreateSession
- ActivateSession
- DeleteSession

View
~~~~

- Browse
- BrowserNext
- RegisterNodes
- UnregisterNodes
- TranslateBrowsePathsToNodeIds

Attribute
~~~~~~~~~

- Read
- Write

Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CreateSubscription
- MofifySubscription
- SetPublishing
- Publish (Handled by the Runtime itself)
- DeleteSubscription

MonitoredItems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client is able to handle both types of monitored items (event and sampling).
The only difference in handling is the callbacks that are called for both
types. 

- CreateMonitoredItems
- DeleteMonitoredItems
- ModifyMonitoredItems
- SetMonitoringMode

Security
~~~~~~~~

The OPC UA client uses the existing security related runtime interfaces
to handle the encryption algorithms and certificates. The client registers
itself to the certificate store for easy configuration of the client
certificates.

SecurityProfiles:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- None
- Basic256Sha256 (Sign, Sign_and_Encrypt)

User token policy:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Anonymouse
- Username

Known restrictions
------------------

- The client is not able to handle republish right now.
- The client does not support other user tokes then Anonymous and Username
- The client does not support the security policies added with OPC UA 1.04

Platforms
---------

As the OPC UA client is completely ported to the CODESYS runtime system
the client works out of the box on all platforms that supports required
components needed by this component. The current used resources depends
on use cases implemented with this client SDK. The unterlying OPC UA 
stack is identical for the server and the client components and is only 
instantiated once.
