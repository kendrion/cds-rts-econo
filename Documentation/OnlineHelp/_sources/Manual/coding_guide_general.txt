General
-------

1. Implementation in standard ANSI-C (no C99 extensions!)
2. No C++ comments in the code! Some C-Compilers do not support this.
3. Switch on the highest warning level in the compiler or use strict ANSI-C
4. Every component must implement the standard component interface (see :ref:`arch_comp_itf_architecture`)
