Naming conventions and identifier
---------------------------------

1. | The names of all components have to begin always with **Cmp**, e.g.:
   | CmpApp for the application component. The system components have to begin always with **Sys** and the IO driver always with **IoDrv**.

2. | Function names in component interfaces should always have a component prefix attached to make sure they are unique. 
   | The prefix should be as short as possible (ideally 3 or 4 characters), e.g.:
   | **App**\ Create(); /\* Create component function CmpApp \*/

3. | Customer-specific components should always have the company name attached, e.g.:
   | CmpApp3S (3S specific components which replace the standard CmpApp component)
   | or:
   | Cmp3S (3S specific components, which is loaded as an extension of the runtime system)

4. Names of functions, variables and structures in *camel case*:
   
   -  Functions begin with upper case letters
   -  Variables with lower case letters
   -  Structures begin with upper case letters

   .. note:: External library functions are always written in lower case, to distinguish them from C functions, which usually have the same name!

5. | Constants or defines are always written in upper case letters, e.g.
   | #define MAX\_APPLICATIONS 10
   | The pre-processor instructions must also have to be written in
     upper case letters.

6. Use always the so called "Systems Hungarian notation" in variables
   (see next chapter).
