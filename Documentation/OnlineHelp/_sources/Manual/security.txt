Security
========

More and more controllers and plants are networked with each other and so there is an increasing need to improve the security aspects in every controller,
which is envolved in this plant or security area!

Basic infrastructure
--------------------

In the runtime system there are some basic infrastructure components, on which most of the security components are based on:

Security manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The security manager component hold the security policy of all security relevant components.

The security manager implements the following interface and must be added, if at least one security component is used in the runtime system:

    - :ref:`CmpSecurityManagerItf <group___cmp_security_manager_itf>`

    
OpenSSL
~~~~~~~

We use OpenSSL for variant security aspects. This is the most important and critical component for security.

OpenSSL implements the following interfaces:

    - :ref:`CmpCryptoItf <group___cmp_crypto_itf>`
    
    - :ref:`CmpTlsItf <group___cmp_tls_itf>`
    
    - :ref:`CmpX509Cert <group___cmp_x509_cert_itf>`
    
    - :ref:`SysSocket2Itf <group___sys_socket2_itf>`

Security features
-----------------

All current available security features of the runtime system are described in the :ref:`security feature documentation <Security Features>`.

.. node:
    We recommend to use all available features to protect your controller as best! But dependent on the performance and available resources of your controller,
    you can add each feature separately.
