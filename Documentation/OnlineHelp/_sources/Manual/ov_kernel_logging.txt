Logging
-------

The logger component (CmpLog) has the possibility to log all events of
the runtime system like the startup and shutdown and all application
downloads.

The logger can be instantiated, so each component can create its own
logger.

One logger instance is always available and this is called the standard
logger. In the standard logger, all components log by default.

One log entry consists of:

+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Entry                         | Description                                       |
+===============================+===================================================+
| Timestamp                     | Can be a RTC, microsecond or millisecond value    |
|                               | (depends on the log options)                      |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| ComponentId of the component, | Each component in the runtime system has a unique |                                                                                   
| that specifies the log entry  | Id. This Id must be specified here to recognize   |
|                               | the source of the log entry.                      |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Log class                     | The following log classes are available:          |
|                               |                                                   |

The standard logger is configured this way by default:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LOG\_ALL but with excluded LOG\_DEBUG entries. To enable the debug log
entries you have to enable this by configuring the log filter in the
CODESYSControl.cfg file:

.. code-block:: C

 [CmpLog]
 Logger.0.Name=PlcLog
 Logger.0.Filter=0xFFFFFFFF

Usage out of a Runtime System Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The log entries can be added to the standard logger with the interface
function LogAdd(). It can be used for example:

.. code-block:: C

  CAL\_LogAdd(STD\_LOGGER, COMPONENT\_ID, LOG\_ERROR, ERR\_FAILED,
  LOGID\_CmpApp\_OpenBootprojectFailed, "<app>%s</app>", pszAppName);

Usage out of an IEC Application/Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the logger is used out of an IEC application (via CmpLog.library).
the component ID must be unique the following way:

1. | The IEC code bit must always be set:
   | #defineÂ CMPID\_IecCode 0x00001000

2. The HIGHWORD must contain the VendorID

3. The LOWWORD can contain the unique ID, that is coordinated by the
   vendor

Example:

   | VendorID: 0x1234
   | IECCode Bit: 0x00001000
   | Component/LibraryID: 0x0005
   | => ComponentID = 0x12341005

That the component name can be resolved with its name, the Library have
to register its ComponentID with the corresponding name at the component
manager via ComponentManager.library.

.. code-block:: C

 hCmp : RTS_IEC_HANDLE;
 hCmp := CMAddComponent('MyLibrary', 0x12341005, 0x03050500, 0);

Typically this can be done in the FB\_Init Method of a function block.

Additionally the Library have to deregister its component name via the
following function:

.. code-block:: C

 CMRemoveComponent(hCmp);

Typically this can be done in the FB\_Exit Method of a function block.
