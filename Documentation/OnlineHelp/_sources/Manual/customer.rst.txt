Customer Adaptations and Expansions
===================================

There are several different possibilities to extend and adapt the
runtime system to your own needs.

You can use the provided and existing components and can arrange them to
a set of components with the functionality you need. This issue is
called *scalability*. For some components, you have the choice under
several different implementations with different functionality and
resource requirements.

As the second possibility, you can configure these provided standard
components to your needs. Here you can specify the behavior and the
resource needs of the runtime system. This issue is called
*configurability*.

The third way is write your own component to replace an existing
component or to add this component additionally to the runtime system.
This is called *extensibility*.

Each of these issues will be described in detail in the following
chapters.
