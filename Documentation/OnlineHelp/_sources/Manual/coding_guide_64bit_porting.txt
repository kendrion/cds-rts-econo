64-Bit Porting rules
--------------------

There are some special rules which you have to follow, that your
component can be compiled and can run on a 64-Bit Targets:

1. All public interfaces and structures must use the predefined RTS\_
   datatypes

2. A pointer to an object must be a pointer or RTS\_HANDLE

3. Integer calculations on pointers must be done with RTS\_UINTPTR resp.
   RTS\_INTPTR

4. All offset and sizes that worked with memory or file objects must use
   the RTS\_SIZE datatype

5. RTS\_PTRDIFF should be used for differences of pointers, loop
   counters, array indexing, size storage and address arithmetic

6. All variables with a fix size on every platform must use the RTS\_
   datatypes with defined size, e.g. RTS\_UI16

7. Portable format specifiers must be used for printf and scanf (see
   next chapter)
