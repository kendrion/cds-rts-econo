Main I/O Driver Interfaces
--------------------------

To understand how an I/O driver works internally, we need to take a look
at the interfaces that an I/O driver has to implement.

If the driver is written in C/C++ you can find the available interfaces
in the directory components. The interface header files always begin
with CmpIpDrv and ends (like every interface) with Itf.h:

CmpIoDrv…Itf.h

If you intend to write an I/O driver in IEC, you can find the interface
in the corresponding libraries with the following structure:

IioDrv... .library

IBase
~~~~~

The IBase interface is the mandatory interface that every I/O driver has
to implement! It Contains the following functions:

IBase (C/C++, the Parameter pIBase is only needed for C-drivers):

1. void \*QueryInterface (Ibase \*pIBase, ITFID ItfId, RTS_RESULT \*pResult)
2. int AddRef(Ibase \*pIBase)
3. int Release(Ibase \*pIBase)

IBase (IEC):

1. PointER TO BYTE QueryInterface (ITFID ItfId, PointER TO Udint
   \*pResult)
2. Dint AddRef()
3. Dint Release()

With the QueryInterface() function, an I/O driver can be requested for
an interface, that the I/O driver implements. The corresponding
interface pointer is returned by this function.

| An interface is always specified and can be requested by an ID. To
  save memory, the ID is only a 32-Bit number and no GUID. But this
  causes to manage all interface IDs. The ID consists of the high word
  vendor Id and the low word interface Id. So every vendor can create
  its own interfaces.
| A list of all available interface IDs that are used in the runtime
  system can be found in the header file CmpItf.h or for IEC-driver in
  the corresponding interface libraries.

The AddRef() function is always called implicitly, if a QueryInterface
call was successful to increase a reference counter of this object.

The Release() can be called to release an interface pointer, that was
provided by QueryInterface. This function decrements the reference
counter of an object.

If the reference counter is 0, the object will be deleted.

.. _icmpiodrv:

ICmpIoDrv
~~~~~~~~~

The most important interface, that an I/O driver can implement, is the
IcmpIoDrv interface. It contains the following functions for different
issues:

Identification functions:

.. code-block:: C

    typedef struct tagIoDrvInfo
    {
        RTS_IEC_WORD wId; // Index of the instance
        RTS_IEC_WORD wModuleType; // Supported module type
        RTS_IEC_DWORD hSpecific; // Specific handle
        RTS_IEC_string szDriverName[32]; // driver name
        RTS_IEC_string szVendorName[32]; // vendor name
        RTS_IEC_string szDeviceName[32]; // device name
        RTS_IEC_string szFirmwareVersion[64]; // Firmware version
        RTS_IEC_DWORD dwVersion; // Version of the driver
    } IoDrvInfo;

RTS_RESULT IoDrvGetInfo(IoDrvInfo \**ppIoDrv):

With this function, some generic information can be requested like
driver name (see structure above), device name that is supported by the
driver, vendor name and firmware number (if the supported device has an
own firmware on it like the hilscher cards).

RTS_RESULT IoDrvIdentify(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector):

By calling this function, the I/O driver should identify itfs device,
like blinking some LEDs, stopping the bus, etc. It is planned to call
this function by a menu action on the device in the plc-configuration to
physically identify this device. This could be very useful, if there are
several identical cards plugged in the plc and the assignment in the
plc-configuration in CODESYS is unclear.

*Configuration:* (called during application download)

RTS_RESULT IoDrvUpdateConfiguration(IoConfigConnector \*pConnectorList,
int nCount):

This function is called at download of the application that contains the
I/O-configuration. Each driver instance gets the complete list of
connectors!

The first thing that must be done in this function is to detect the
connector that is supported by the I/O-driver. For this, the I/O driver
can request the Io-manager for the first connector with the specified
type Id, like:

pConnector = CAL_IoMgrConfigGetFirstConnector(pConnectorList, &nCount, 0x0020);

Here, the first connector with the Id 0x0020 (=CT\_PROFIBUS\_MASTER) is
searched. See :ref:`_dev_io_conf_device_descriptions <connectors>` for detailed information.

If the first connector with the matching type is found (pConnector is
unequal 0), it must be checked:

-  if it is correct supported device
-  if the connector is not supported already by a previous instance

To check, if is the correct device, typically some additional parameters
are used to detect this like vendor name, device name or specific device
id.

To check if the connector is free and can be used and it is not occupied
by another instance, therefore the connector entry hIoDrv must be
checked for 0 or -1. In both cases, the I/O-connector is free and can be
used. To occupy the connector, the driver has to write ist handle into
the connector.

So typical sequence of IoDrvUpdateConfiguration looks like in C:

.. code-block:: C

    IBase *pIBase;
    IoConfigConnector *pConnector = CAL_IoMgrConfigGetFirstConnector(pConnectorList, &nCount, CT_PROFIBUS_MASTER);

    while (pConnector != NULL)
    {
        IoDrvInfo *pInfo;
        IoConfigParameter *pParameter;
        char *pszVendorName = NULL;
        char *pszDeviceName = NULL;

        IoDrvGetInfo(hIoDrv, &pInfo);

        pParameter = CAL_IoMgrConfigGetParameter(pConnector, 393218);
        if (pParameter != NULL && pParameter->dwFlags & PVF_Pointer)
            pszVendorName = (char *)pParameter->dwValue;

        pParameter = CAL_IoMgrConfigGetParameter(pConnector, 393219);
        if (pParameter != NULL && pParameter->dwFlags & PVF_Pointer)
            pszDeviceName = (char *)pParameter->dwValue;

        if  (pConnector->hIoDrv == 0 &&
            pszVendorName != NULL && strcmp(pszVendorName, pInfo->szVendorName) == 0 &&
            pszDeviceName != NULL && strcmp(pszDeviceName, pInfo->szDeviceName) == 0)
        {
            pConnector->hIoDrv = (RTS_IEC_DWORD)pIBase;

In IEC you can find the appropriate sequence in the template driver. It
looks quite the same.

After detecting the right connector, the next step in the function
IoDrvUpdateConfiguration is to configure the physical device with the
connector parameters and optional to detect all slaves (if is a fieldbus
master).

To detect the slaves, the I/O-manager provides some interface functions
too:

.. code-block:: C

    pChild = CAL_IoMgrConfigGetFirstChild(pConnectorList, &nCount, pConnectorFather);

With this function, the first child of the father connector
pConnectorFather was returned.

The next child (slave) can be requested by:

.. code-block:: C

    pChild = CAL_IoMgrConfigGetNextChild(pChild, &nCount, pConnectorFather);

.. note:: 
 ATTENTION: The driver must register its instance at each supported connector 
 (also PCI connectors, slaves, etc.). This must be done in the hIoDrv component of the corresponding connector, like:

.. code-block:: C

    pChild->hIoDrv = (RTS_IEC_DWORD)pIBase;

RTS_RESULT IoDrvUpdateMapping(IoConfigTaskMap  \*pTaskMapList, int
nCount):

The driver is called with the so called task map list. A Task map
contains the following information:

+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Element                                    | IEC Data type       |
+============================================+=====================+
| Task ID                                    | DWORD               |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Type (Input or Output)                     | WORD                |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Number of connector maps                   | WORD                |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Pointer to connector map list              | PointER             |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+

A connector map list contains the following information:

+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Element                                    | IEC Data type       |
+============================================+=====================+
| Pointer to a connector                     | DWORD               |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Number of channel maps                     | WORD                |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Pointer to channel map list                | POINTER             |
+--------------------------------------------+---------------------+

The complete I/O-mapping structure is shown in the following picture:

.. image:: ./images/io_drivers_mapping_structure.png

These are the missing bricks to understand the I/O-mapping.

The task map contains all mapping information for each task, that means,
all I/O-channel that are used by a task. For each task you got one entry
for all inputs and one entry for all outputs.

The task map contains a list of connectors maps, that means on which
connectors the I/O-channels are residing.

And at least, the connector map entry contains a list of channel maps,
which includes the real mapping information, where to copy the inputs to
which offset on the device and where to copy the outputs from the device
to which offset in the application.

In the mapping table, the I/O driver can sort or rearrange entries to
optimize later cyclic access. E.g. several byte channels can be
collected to one byte stream, to use one memcpy at the cyclic update.

*Cyclic Calls*:

RTS_RESULT IoDrvReadInputs(IoConfigConnectorMap \*pConnectorMapList,
int nCount):

This interface function is called at the beginning of a task to read in
all referred input values of this driver. Only one call is done for each
task.

RTS_RESULT IoDrvWriteOutputs(IoConfigConnectorMap \*pConnectorMapList,
int nCount):

This interface function is called at the end of a task to write out all
referred output values of this driver. Only one call is done for each
task.

RTS_RESULT IoDrvStartBusCycle(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector):

This function is used to trigger a bus cycle (if necessary on the
device). This can be specified in the device description as followed, if
a bus cycle is necessary (see :ref:`driver_info`):

.. code-block:: C

    <DriverInfo needsBusCycle="true">
        …
    </DriverInfo>

| In which context this function is called can be specified in the
  IO-configuration.
| On the device dialog in the register card "PLC settings", you can
  specify a dedicated "bus cycle task". If no task is specified here,
  the task with the shortest cycle time is used out of the task
  configuration. With the attribute "useSlowestTask" you can specify in
  your device description, that the slowest task does the bus cycle (see :ref:`driver_info`).
| On the device (e.g. Master), there is a register card "Mapping", where
  you can specify an optional bus cycle task. If no task is specified
  here, the configuration of the device is used (see above) as default.

RTS_RESULT IoDrvWatchdogTrigger(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector):

This function is called cyclically to retrigger a watchdog on the
device. The cycle time must be calculated in the I/O-driver.

*Scanning sub devices/modules*:

RTS_RESULT IoDrvScanModules(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector, IoConfigConnector \**ppConnectorList, int \*pnCount):

This function is called to scan sub devices. This can be used to scan
physically available slaves of fieldbus master, that are connected to
one fieldbus.

It is necessary to enable the scan mechanism in the device description
file. This is done by an additional xml element in the <DriverInfo>
section.

Example:

.. code-block:: C

    <DriverInfo>
        <Scan supported="true" identify="true"></Scan>
    </DriverInfo>

The scan function is enabled for the device and the command is enabled
in the context menu if the device is selected in the device tree.

The identify attribute enables the call of IoDrvIdentify to identify a
scanned device. In most cases a LED is blinking to show the user the
selected device. It is helpful for bus systems without DIP switches for
address setting like sercos or ProfiNet.

In the method IoDrvScanModules the connected devices have to be
returned.

With versions before V3.5 SP2 the method is called only once and
therefore all devices must be scanned at once.

| With version from V3.5 SP2 it is possible to return ERR_PENDING. In
  that case the method IoDrvScanModules is called again and the method
  could return just the found number of devices or 0 if the stack needs
  additional time or calls to collect the available devices.
| The programming and runtime system must support this and it will lower
  the required memory for the scan function.

If flag ConnectorOptions.CO_SCAN_PENDING_SUPPORTED  is set in
pConnector^.wOptions then it is possible to use the pending
functionality.

*Descriptions of parameters*:

IoConfigConnector \*pConnector

It contains the connector for the device (for example master) and the
parameters for starting the scan function.

IoConfigConnector \**ppConnectorList

| Inside the method this parameter has to be set to the memory
  containing a list of connectors for all devices found. If
  CO_SCAN_PENDING_SUPPORTED is not available the memory has to be
  allocated dynamically and freed in FB_Exit or before the next scan
  call.
| If CO_SCAN_PENDING_SUPPORTED is available the method could return a
  pointer to one instance of IoConfigConnector.

.. code-block:: C
  
    Int *pnCount

The method has to set the number of connectors (=devices + sub devices)
stored in the ppConnectorList.

Devices and sub devices could be returned in the connector list. The sub
devices must be directly copied to the memory behind the devices then
the scan mechanism could automatically assign the sub devices.

| Memory content for IoConfigConnector:
| Device 1
| Sub device 1.1
| Sub device 1.2
| Device 2
| Sub device 2.1

Additional parameters:

It is possible to add additional parameters starting with ID 10. For
example the station name or node id could be passed to the device scan
dialog. Additional parameters will be shown in an extra column. If the
parameter ID is also available in the device description then the
parameter values will automatically copied to the devices after
inserting the devices. The access rights of the parameter are set to
readwrite then the column is editable.

Diagnostic information:

RTS_RESULT IoDrvGetModuleDiagnosis(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector):

With this function, device specific diagnostic information are stored in
the connector (diagnostic flags).

ICmpIoDrvParameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface is used to get access to the system parameter of a
device.

RTS_RESULT IoDrvReadParameter(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector,
IoConfigParameter \*pParameter, void \*pData, unsigned long ulBitSize,
unsigned long ulBitOffset):

With this function, the I/O-manager reads the value of a device
parameter. This function is typically called, if an online-service with
a parameter read request is sent to the I/O-manager.

RTS_RESULT IoDrvWriteParameter(IoConfigConnector \*pConnector,
IoConfigParameter \*pParameter, void \*pData, unsigned long ulBitSize,
unsigned long ulBitOffset):

With this function, the I/O-manager writes the value of a device
parameter. This function is typically called, if an online-service with
a parameter write request is sent to the I/O-manager.
