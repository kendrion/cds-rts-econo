Little-endian is specified as the byte order for all fields in all
layers, in order to ensure compatibility between different systems. In
individual cases the byte order of the target device may be used
(application layer). This is explicitly mentioned where appropriate. In
all other cases applies little-endian byte order **always** applies.
