_`Custom tags`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom tags can be found in many places within the description file.
They can be used to store customer-specific information. They are not
transferred to the target system, although they can be evaluated via in
the programming system via PlugIns. A custom tag may have any number of
sub-nodes. In order to keep the description file validatable, all nodes
used should be defined in a scheme, and this scheme should be
referenced.
