Startup sequence
----------------

-  | CH\_INIT:
   | Init your own component local stuff

-  | CH\_INIT2:
   | You can call other component interface functions
   | An event provider must create here the event object!

-  | CH\_INIT3:
   | Further init stuff
   | An event consumer can open here the existing event and register its
     callback routine

-  | CH\_INIT\_TASKS:
   | At this hook you must be aware of multitasking calls!

-  | CH\_INIT\_COMM:
   | Here the communication server are started and open the runtime
     system the the world around

The same in the opposite direction for the shutdown sequence.
