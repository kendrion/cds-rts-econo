Architecture
============

The architecture of the runtime system CODESYS Control V3 based on a
component oriented model. Each logical, functional part of the runtime
system is separated in one (or more) components.

Each component has a well-defined interface. Via this interface, other
components can have access to this component. Because a component has a
specified interface, it can be replaced by another component that
implements this interface.

Additionally a component can have a dependency to other components, if
this component uses their interfaces to operate.

Because of this component model, components can be arranged together to
a complete runtime system. This runtime system can be a very small one
with less functionality or a full ranged runtime system with all
features! This depends only on the number and kind of components that
are arranged together.

Most of the components are system and processor independent and they can
run on small 16-Bit up to powerful 32-Bit systems. This is realized by a
"single-source" of the runtime system.
