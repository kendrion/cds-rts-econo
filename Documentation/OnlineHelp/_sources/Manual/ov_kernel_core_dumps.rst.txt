Core dumps (CmpCoreDump)
------------------------

A Core dump is a file which captures the state of an application at a
certain point in its execution. Usually such a file is created after an
exception or crash in the application occurs. This file can then be used
to debug the crash without access to the PLC. When this file is loaded
in CODESYS it allows to monitor all variables in the application and
shows additional details about the crash, like the call stack. All
information is retrieved solely from the file.

For a CODESYS application this file contains the following information:

-  Contents of the memory (the areas)

-  The call stack

-  The stack

-  The device log

If CmpCoreDump is included in the runtime, such a dump file is created
automatically when an exception occurs in the application. If no storage
is available on the PLC, a dump can also be created and stored on the
engineering station with CODESYS. For this the component also provides
additional services to make the dump as complete as possible.
