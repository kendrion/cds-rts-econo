Overview of the Kernel Components and Main Functions
====================================================

As described in the previous chapter, the runtime system V3 consists of
single components that can be arranged and configured for different
targets to reach every set of features.

All components can be assigned to one of the following categories:

1. Component-Manager: This is the central component that must always be part of a runtime system.

2. System-Components: Adaptation to the operating system and the processor

3. Communication-Stack: The component realizes the complete communication stack.

4. Application-Management: The component realizes the handling and management of the PLC applications and the PLC tasks.

5. Core: These components are further components of the core of the runtime system.

6. Optional components: Optional components can be integrated optionally in the runtime system. 
The usage depends on the target conditions or the feature set that should be reached. For example the target visualization components refer to this category.

In this chapter in the following the main components and their
functionality is described in detail.
