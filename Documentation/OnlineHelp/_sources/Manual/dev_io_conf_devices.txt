Devices
-------

Devices represent, strictly speaking, hardware units that are relevant
for the controller configuration. They may be programmable devices
(PLC), local I/O units, extension modules, field bus nodes, or bus
coupler modules. In a wider sense the term may also include functional
hardware units that are selectable or configurable by the user but have
no direct hardware equivalent. Unless otherwise specified, in the
following sections the term device is used in this wider sense. With
regard to the device description and the interface both aspects are also
treated equally.

Devices may be linked hierarchically. The possible combinations are
defined in the respective description files. The link points of the
devices are referred to as *Connectors*. Connectors can either take a
*Parent* role or a *Child* role. Depending on the configuration, between
*1* and *n* devices with suitable child connectors can be attached to
Parent connectors.

In diagrams the following symbols are used for illustration purposes: a
device is represented by a large rectangle. Smaller rectangles to the
left of the device indicate child connectors, i.e. points where the
device can be attached to a parent node. The same type of rectangle on
the right-hand side represents parent connectors, i.e. possible
connection points for children.
