Memory Management
-----------------

In embedded system, the usage of the memory must reach the following
requirements:

-  Usage of dynamic memory only at start up

-  Avoid memory fragmentation with usage of alloc and free

-  Static memory should be preferred

These requirements are covered by the CmpMemPool component. This
component allows to use a static array that can be split up into a
chained list of memory objects with the same size and this is called a
memory pool. One memory block from the pool can then be used and free-ed
with the CmpMemPool component. The unused blocks are incorporated in the
memory pool to use it for the next object.

If all block of the pool are used, there is the possibility to allocate
new block from the heap memory. If you release such memory block from
the heap, the memory is not physically release! The block is
incorporated in the memory pool to use it for the next object.
