Technology: ANSI-C and C++
--------------------------

All components are implemented in ANSI-C, because a C-Compiler is
available for nearly all controllers, processors and operating-systems.
So ANSI-C typically is the language to write own components. But you can
write your own component in C++ with a C Interface.

But the architecture of CODESYS Control V3 has one additional big
benefit: All components can alternatively be used with C++-Interfaces in
object oriented environments! This is realized as a C++ wrapper around
all components.

So it is on your choice to use the runtime system with C or with C++
interfaces. If you would like to write your own component in C++, the
only thing you have to do is to compile the runtime system with the
specific define CPLUSPLUS. After this you see around your component only
C++ interfaces!

How this was realized in the component interface, this is explained in
detail in :ref:`arch_comp_itf_architecture`.
