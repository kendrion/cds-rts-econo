Device Description
==================

A so called device description contains all information for a PLC needed by the CODESYS development system to manage this device 
(you can think about a printer driver description here). This device description can be installed in the device repository of CODESYS and then you can add this device 
in the device tree of a project.

Additionally a device description can specify an IO-device (like a fieldbus master, a slave, a local IO-module, etc.) with its IO-channels, connectors and all necessary 
information. This device description can be installed in the device repository of CODESYS too and afterwards you can add this module in the IO-configuration in CODESYS.

A device description has an XML format and the file extension is named ".devdesc.xml". The XML format must follow a defined scheme (can be downloaded 
here :ref:`device_description_schema` as a chm-helpfile).

So every device description file has a typical structure:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
    <DeviceDescription xmlns="http://www.3s-software.com/schemas/DeviceDescription-1.0.xsd" xmlns:ts="http://www.3s-software.com/schemas/TargetSettings-0.1.xsd">
        <Types></Types>
        <Strings></Strings>
        <Files></Files>
        <Device>
            <DeviceIdentification></DeviceIdentification>
            <DeviceInfo></DeviceInfo>
            <DriverInfo></DriverInfo>
            <DeviceParameterSet></DeviceParameterSet>
            <Functional></Functional>
            <ExtendedSettings></ExtendedSettings>
            <Connector></Connector>         
        </Device>
    </DeviceDescription>

In the chapter :ref:`dev_desc_basics` we describe the *basics* (types, strings, files, etc.).

In the chapter :ref:`dev_desc_device` we describe the *device* node for PLC's.

And in the chapter :ref:`dev_io_configuration` we describe the *device* node for IO-modules.
