I/O Drivers
===========

An I/O driver is a component that operates and supports a specific
hardware or device. Such an I/O driver typically has to perform the
following functions:

-  Physical access to the device

-  Detection and initialization of the device

-  Data access to and data exchange with the device (update of IO
   channels)

-  Support of diagnostic information of the device

-  Optional functions like scanning sub devices, parameter access, etc.

The update of IO channels can be illustrated like this:

This is a simplified picture. There can be more than one I/O driver
instance. Each instance will update parts of the Inputs and Outputs
data. Even with more than one task, there is only one Inputs and one
Outputs area.

The cloud symbolizes I/O driver specific data. This can be shared memory
of a Hilscher fieldbus card, or the contents of a CANOpen or EtherCAT
message.
