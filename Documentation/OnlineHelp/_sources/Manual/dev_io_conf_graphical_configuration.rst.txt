Graphical Configuration
-----------------------

The IO-configuration in CODESYS is organized as a tree of
devices:

.. image:: ./images/device_io_tree_in_codesys.png

The base node for the devices typically is a PLC (the runtime system;
sometimes called target). In the example above it is a windows runtime
system with the name CODESYS\_SP\_for\_Win32.

A PLC node specifies typically, which kind of devices can be appended
under this node. For example on a PC you can append (and physically
plugin) PCI cards under this node. These appended devices correspond to
the hardware that is plugged and attached to the PLC.

In the example above, a PCI Hilscher Profibus Master Card is appended
under the PLC. Under the Profibus Master there are Profibus Slaves to
configure the complete field bus. This configuration represents the
physical structure of a hardware that is connected and attached on the
PLC.
