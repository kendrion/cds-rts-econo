Coding Guidelines
=================

The runtime system is implemented highly portable, whereby some
restrictions and specifications may arise during the implementation of
its own components or during the modification of existing components.

Below you can find the 3S codeing guidelines for the Runtime System. OEM
customers should follow these coding guidelines, but can adapt it to
their own guidelines and requirements.
