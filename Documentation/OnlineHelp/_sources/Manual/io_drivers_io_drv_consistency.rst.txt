Consistency in the IO Driver
----------------------------

The IO-consistency is realized by the IO-manager only. But to realize
this consistency with a maximum performance, the following conditions
must be fulfilled with support by the IO-driver:

1. Placeholder of IoStandard.library V3.1.3.2 must be integrated in the target description
2. IoDriver must set the DRVPROP\_CONSISTENCY property flag for the Io-Manager (with the interface function IoMgrSetDriverProperties())
3. SysCpuTestAndSet / SysCpuTestAndReset must be used for each bit input and output access in the IoDriver!
