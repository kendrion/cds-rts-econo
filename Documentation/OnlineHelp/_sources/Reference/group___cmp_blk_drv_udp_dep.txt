Detailed Description
--------------------



A block driver for udp networks. It assumes that all node addresses are within the same subnet and thus uses only the last ip component for addressing. It is able to communicate with nodes listening on one of up to four ports, which allows for more then one runtime system running on a single host. Detected devices are named "ether 0" through "ether n" where n+1 is the number of detected network interfaces.
