Detailed Description
--------------------



A block driver for Tcp/Ip networks. The ip-address and port settings are part of the logical address of this blockdriver. In opposite to the CmpBlkDrvUdp, this driver can also communicate with PLCs outside the own subnet, but does only provide a limited broadcast functionality. These are sent only on already open connections, thus there is no real networkscan provided. This driver implemts only one device for all connection instances, called "CmpBlkDrvTcp".
