Detailed Description
--------------------



This component is a very basic implementation of the CmpLog Interface. It only uses SysOut as a backend. There is no interface to other backends like file. No buffering, no online display of log message in the CoDeSys Device window. It only needs very littel of RAM memory, compared to the standard CMpLog. Can be used on very small systems, or for testing, as the logger messages are printed at startup with no delay. The standard CmpLog buffers the startup messages until all components have registered. When creating a new system that doesn't start correctly, it may happen that no messages can be seen. This can be avoided using this component.
