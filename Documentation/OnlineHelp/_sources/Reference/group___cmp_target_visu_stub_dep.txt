Detailed Description
--------------------



This component implements a stub that behaves like a real targetvisualization. The difference is that this stub does not really create a window and paint but communicates with a CmpVisuhandlerStub via inter process communication You can include this component when you want to build a system for a targetvisualization where the targetvisualization lives in an own process. In this case integrate this component into the real runtime system where the visu code is running. This runtime system normally runs in kernelmode!
