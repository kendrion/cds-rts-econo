Compiler switches to enable/disable single features in the component.

- SQLITE_OS_OTHER: The option causes SQLite to omit its built-in operating system interfaces for Unix, Windows, and OS/2. The resulting component will have the CoDeSys RTS operating system interface.

- SQLITE_THREADSAFE: This option controls whether or not code is included in SQLite to enable it to operate safely in a multithreaded environment. The default is SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1 which is safe for use in a multithreaded environment. When compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0 all mutexing code is omitted and it is unsafe to use SQLite in a multithreaded program. When compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2, SQLite can be used in a multithreaded program so long as no two threads attempt to use the same database connection at the same time.
